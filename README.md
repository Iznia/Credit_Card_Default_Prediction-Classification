# Credit Card Default Prediction


## Objectives
This project is created to evaluate classification concepts, focusing on the following:

- Understanding classification concepts with Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN.
- Data preparation for Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN models.
- Implementing Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN to make predictions.


### Problem Statement
Credit card companies face significant challenges in predicting whether a customer will default on their payment. Accurate predictions help these companies manage risk and make informed decisions regarding credit limits and interest rates. The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will default on their payment next month based on their financial history and demographic information.

### Objective
This project seeks to develop and evaluate classification models using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict credit card default. The performance of these models will be assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
